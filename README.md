Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository's master branch.

In the pull request name, add your Prograd id, name, and last name separated by a dash "-".

## Deliverables

You need to generate the starter code and fill it with the necessary code to satisfy the requirements described below.

## Introduction

The goal here is to work on a small projects where you can practice the concepts we've learned thus far.

## Starter Code

To generate the starter code, follow the steps given below

- To create a new application,
    - Open your ubuntu or cmd terminal and execute the following command
      - ```ng new app-name```
      - for example, ng new super-wars

## PROGRESSION #1: Layout

In the project, we are going to create an angular layout with headerm footer and navigation bar in your project. We are going to create three different components:

- The `Header` component will contain the page header along with the heading.
- The `Footer` component will contain your page footer.
- The `Navigation` component will contain your page navigation bar with two links home and about us.

You can check the sample output as a reference to do this project. 

The first thing you will have to do is to generate the project with `Angular CLI`.
